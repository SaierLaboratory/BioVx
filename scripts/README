Some modifications by Gabriel Moreno-Hagelsieb

Note 1:
   Pranav Iddamsetty and Arturo Medrano
   added the scripts tmsplit and tmsFunction.py.
   These programs provide a command-line interface
   to cut transporter sequences under the same 
   criteria as the website:

   http://biotools.tcdb.org/bartms_split.html

Note 2:
   The program gblast3.py was modified by 
   Pranav Iddamsetty and Arturo Medrano to
   generate a tabulated file (results.tsv) with
   the same output as results.html. This will
   allow further automatic processing of gblast
   output (e.g. compare different outputs of gblast
   to identify commonalities/differences between
   trasporter systems in different genomes). 
   This program was also modified to add annotated
   substrates in tcdb to the output. Currently the
   substrates are read from flat files but as soon
   as the substrates are uploaded to TCDB we will
   modify the script to read the substrates directly
   from the database.

Note 3:
   The programs quod.py, tcblast.py and hvordan.py were
   added by Kevin Hendargo and Arturo Medrano. The script
   quod.py runs WHAT from the command line on one or more
   sequences and is able to generate the plots in different
   formats and qualities. The script tcblast.py provides
   functions to run blast against tcdb from the command
   line and provides graphical display that will be used
   by the last script hvordan.py, which runs blast and WHAT
   in order to generated an html ouput file that will help
   the user to make the biological interpretation of
   protocol2 top hits. This is the official repository:
