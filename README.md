# Welcome to the repository of the Extended BioV suite of programs

The original programs in the suite were originally written by Vamsee Reddy, many have been updated and new programs have been added by different members of the lab and collaborators.

Find below the list of programs available. Scripts developed by our group as dependencies are not listed here but are included in the distribution:  

**1.** protocol1.py   ([Manual](manuals/BioV_manual.pdf))  
**2.** protocol2.py   ([Manual](manuals/BioV_manual.pdf))  
**3.** gsat.py        ([Manual](manuals/BioV_manual.pdf))  
**4.** gblast3.py     ([Manual](manuals/BioV_manual.pdf))    
**5.** tmstats.py     ([Manual](manuals/BioV_manual.pdf))  
**6.** tss.py         ([Manual](manuals/BioV_manual.pdf))  
**7.** ssearch.py     ([Manual](manuals/BioV_manual.pdf))  
**8.** ancient.py     ([Manual](manuals/AR_INSTRUCTIONS.pdf))   
**9.** quod.py        ([Manual](https://gitlab.com//khendarg/hvordan/blob/master/docs/quod.md))  
**10.** hvordan.py    ([Manual](https://gitlab.com/khendarg/hvordan/blob/master/docs/hvordan.md))  
**11.** tmsplit.py    ([Manual](manuals/tmsplit.md))  
**12.** deuterocol.py ([Manual](https://github.com/SaierLaboratory/deuterocol))  
**13.** YutanpaNet.py ([Manual](manuals/YutanpaNet.md))

* **Note 1:**  
The BioV manual needs to be updated.  

* **Note 2:**  
Some improvements to protocol 2 and other programs
were introduced by Gabriel Moreno-Hagelsieb.   

* **Note 3:**  
Pranav Iddamsetty and Arturo Medrano-Soto added the scripts
_tmsplit.py_ and _tmsFunction.py_. These programs provide a 
command-line interface to cut transporter sequences
under the same criteria as the website: http://biotools.tcdb.org/bartms_split.html  

* **Note 4:**  
The program _gblast3.py_ was improved by Pranav Iddamsetty, 
Gabriel Moreno-Hagelsieb and Arturo Medrano-Soto.   

* **Note 5:**  
The programs _quod.py_, _tcblast.py_, _hvordan.py_ and _deuterocol.py_ 
were added by Kevin Hendargo and Arturo Medrano-Soto. The script quod.py 
runs WHAT from the command line on one or more sequences and is able 
to generate the plots in different formats and qualities. The script 
_tcblast.py_ provides functions to run blast against tcdb from the 
command line and generates a graphical display that will be used by 
the last script _hvordan.py_, which runs blast and QUOD in order to 
generate an html ouput file that will help the user to make the 
biological interpretation of protocol2 top hits.  

* **Note 6:**  
Programs _searchPseudogenes.py_, _searchMissComponents.py_, _singEasy.py_,
_YutanpaNet.py_, and _showsubnet.py_ were added by Yichi Zhang and Arturo
Medrano-Soto.
